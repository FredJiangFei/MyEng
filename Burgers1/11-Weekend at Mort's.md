That was my butt.

What are you looking at?

Smart money's on boogers.

It's not a booger.

Let the man think for himself!

I don't think it's a booger.

Who asked you?!

It's getting bigger.

It knows what we're thinking.
Huh.

It is definitely growing.

I just hope it's not
that green mould.

It's called green mould.

You see it in a lot
of beach towns,

and filthy, disgusting,
poorly managed restaurants.

Hey!
So, they had to send you, Hugo?

There's no one else
that does this?

I just got mould-certified.

In a month, I'll be cleared
for vermin, too.

Oh, congratulations.

Okay, gene, if you eat this
mould I'll give you five...

Whoa.

Mmm.
Gorgonzola.

So what do I got to do?

Use bleach on it or something?

(CHUCKLES)
Use bleach on it?

Oh, I'll just put bleach on it.

No, of course not, Bob.
I hate you.

This is big.
You have to close.

The whole building will have
to be tented for 48 hours.

Great.

There goes our weekend revenue.

Ooh, two days off!

Bobby, we could use it.

I guess it has been a while
since we've had a break.

Yeah. Ten years.

What?
That's... can't be right.

Ten years.

You're really living
the dream, Linda.

Aren't you done, Hugo?
Sure, Bob, I'm done.

Mould! Dangerous killer mould!

Floating death spores!
Everyone move!

Gene, how are you feeling?

Kind of nauseous.
A little light-headed.

Pretty good.

Glad I ate it.

You say that about everything.
Yeah.

Green mould, huh?

Yeah. You ever dealt
with this stuff?

Oh, sure.

We get all kinds of mouldy
bodies at the home.

Not on the bodies.
I mean on the walls or...

And you should see the shut-ins.
Stop.

One guy's back looked
like a putting green!

Oh, dear lord.

Hey, you got to get out
of the apartment

while the mould guys work, right?

Yeah. We're going
to go to a motel.

And we're going to tear
into that mini bar!

Yeah, we're going
to go on a bender.

No, we're not.
Yes, we are.

I'm going to drink some
baileys and unwind.

Hey, guys,

stay with me.

No. I mean... I appreciate the
offer, but I... Listen to me.

I live alone
in an enormous apartment.

That happens to be
above a funeral home.

Hmm.
So, come on, stay with me.

Ah, thanks!
Yeah! Yeah, yeah!

Linda, seriously, you want
to stay in a funeral home?

Why not?
Yes, yes!

It'll be fun.
Is it spooky?

You mean, do I have
a medicine cabinet

full of corpse moisturisers?

Ooh!
Yes.

Do they make my skin
soft as a baby?

You decide.

(GASPS)
It's not greasy, either.

Tina, touch.

(GROANS)

Come on, go get
your toothbrushes.

Yeah-yeah-yes-yes-yes... yes!

Here we go.

(ALL GASPING)

Hey, I'm not horrified
at all. Aw.

BOB:
Wow. I didn't know you were rich.

Kids, off the furniture.
Well, I get a lot of stuff cheap.

Everything in here
had someone die on it.

Kids!
Off the furniture!

Your room's right down the hall.

All right, kids, let's go.

No, leave the kids.

This weekend, I'm Uncle.

You seriously want
to watch my kids?

(VARIOUS RADIO STATION SIGNALS)

:
Uh...

(CHUCKLES) Yes.
The whole weekend.

This should be
a vacation for you two.

Oh, we can make it the
honeymoon we never had.

Sure. You know, I got the bed
you're sleeping in

because a man died in it.

Making love.
Huh?

Good God.
Mm-hmm.

It's a haunted honeymoon.

Woo-oo.

KIDS:
Woo-oo!

(GRUNTS)

LINDA:
Two whole days off

from the restaurant. Oh!

I know.

What are we gonna do
with ourselves?

Well, I know what I'm gonna do.

First, I'm gonna take these off.

(ZIPPER UNZIPPING)
Oh! These bad boys.

Bobby.
Hmm?

You gonna slip into something
more comfortable?

And I'm gonna get these on.

Oh, are those your, uh...?
My lazy pants? Yes.

Well, I guess
they come off easy.

And, uh, now I will
get this guy out.

Ah, uh-huh, uh-huh.

And let the vacation begin.
What the hell is that?

It's my model.

Since when do you do models?

It's a hobby of mine, Lin.

From back when I could
still have hobbies.

I just relax, turn my brain off

and enjoy the thrill
of the build.

The bus from speed?
Yeah, the bus from speed.

I didn't even know you liked that
movie so much. I never saw it.

I don't like to see the movie
until I finish the model.

Hmm.
Makes it more fun.

Wouldn't it be more fun
if we did something together,

like, uh...
Like couples manicures?

Or couples waxing?

You could get a man-zillian.

That stuff is for people
who are dating, Linda.

We... we do other
couples stuff.

We couples-live together.
And that's even better.

You know what? I'm gonna go.
Okay, good.

Yeah.
I mean, okay.

Going to be all by myself.

On my honeymoon, I might add.

It's not our honeymoon, Linda.

Hey, look!

It comes with a little Keanu!

Hi, guy.
(HIGH-PITCHED): Hi, Bob.

Missed you, buddy.

Oh, for Pete's sakes,
you big freak.

Bet you never knew
washing out rubber tubing

could be such
a blast, huh, kids?

Well, I had a feeling.

Who wants to help me glue a
toupee on an old man's cadaver?

Yay!
This is like camp.

(GROANS)

Tina, what's bothering you?
The wig or the cadaver?

The cadaver.
Wigs can be scary.

You know what? Why don't
you kids go ahead and take five?

Explore the morgue.

But stay away from my computer.

Not because of porn.

This computer?
Come on, now.

What's this?
No...

TINA: "A dating web site
for icians."

, you got a message.

Yeah. Well, this lady and I
have been messaging.

I sent her a "wink." She sent me
back a "kissy face."

Kissy face?
That's a big deal.

You need to take
this relationship

into the real world,.

Yeah, reality,.

"Meatspace."

Get into it.

Nah.
I'm not ready.

Ah, you're right,.

You're wh-what, 50?

Wait till you're ready.

50?!
I'm 35 years old!

Huh?

If you believe
my dating profile.

(ALL LAUGHING)

And... send.

What?
What'd you do?

Wash you hairpiece,.
You're going on a date.

Oh, Keanu.

(HIGH-PITCHED):
Give me long sleeves.

Okay... why?
You look great in a T.

(HIGH-PITCHED): I don't know.
I just switch it up.

Okay. No, no, no,
make me one of those tuxedo t-shirts.

Do that. That'll be funny.

Well, that's stupid.
I don't like those.

Ah, I see you're still
playing with your dolls.

Mm-hmm.
I just got back from a salsa boot camp.

I was the lonely little
salsa-ita. All by myself.

(HIGH-PITCHED):
Eh, she's back. Hey, just be cool.

LOUISE:
Mom, dad, come quick! Oh, my God!

What? What is it?
What's wrong?

Oh, nothing.
This is just silly.

Asked a girl on a date.

A date?

It was the kids' idea.

Yup.
I proposed a romantic rendezvous

for 8:00 P.M. tonight
at the elegant Jimmy Pesto's.

What? Jimmy Pesto's?

What?
I only know two restaurants.

And they have cloth napkins.

Don't rub it in.
Calm down.

Hey, she replied.

Already?
Too soon. Am I right?

It's not a good sign.

", it's a date.
See you at 8:00."

She's a rhymer.

Go,.

I mean, it could be
fun, two icians...

Hey, what if you
and Linda come, too?

No. No...
Yeah. A double date.

Oh, but who would
watch the kids?

Right. Yeah.

Tina can babysit.

I can?

Oh, come on.

We're a little old
to be babysat.

Isn't that an outdated concept?

No.

Need I remind you what happened

last time she was quote-unquote
in charge?

Free swim!

Special delivery.
(COUGHS)

Hobo dinner!

Oh, pshh.

We'll just be right
across the street.

Tina can call us
on the emergency cell phone

if she needs to.

All right.

You bought the ticket,
you take the ride.

Come on, Linda.
We shouldn't go to this.

It will be bad.

Bob, we are going out tonight.

All right, fine, fine.

Yay!

But just for a couple hours.

And I'm wearing my lazy pants.

Okay. And I'm gonna
drink. A lot.

Yay! Double date!
All right!

LINDA (LAUGHING):
Oh! I love it.

I feel like we're in Jamaica!

Ooh!
Jamaican honeymoon.

You be just in time

for pasta-farian night

with garlic dread-sticks, man...
Stop!

Groove with me to...
Uh-uh!

All right...
No.

You're such a jerk.

TINA:
I'm a born babysitter.

Tina brings the fun.

Now... sparkle.

Hi, gene.
Would you like to play a game?

Maybe sing a song?

Uh, Tina?

Will you join me in the corner
for a little powwow? Okay.

You're dying out there, kid.
Yeah.

Everybody hates you.

I know. I'm blowing it.

Should I call for help on
the emergency phone? Hold on.

Maybe you should think outside the box.
Okay.

How many times in our life
will we get a chance

to wander unsupervised
in a morgue?

Yeah, won't that be scary?

Tina, you don't
babysit from here.

You babysit from here.

My boob?

Yes. Your boob.

Really?
Yeah.

What's your boob
telling you, Tina?

I don't know.

(MUFFLED VOICE):
Explore the morgue.

Explore the morgue?

That a girl!

(GENE SCREAMING)

Sorry, just hungry.

Bobby, they're playing our song.

What?

Our song isn't
"ziti tonight."

Oh, I think that's her!

? (LAUGHS)
I recognise you

from the picture
on your web site.

I'm Samantha.

Well, it's quite a pleasure
to meet you, Samantha.

This is my friend Bob

and his lovely wife Linda.

Hi.
Hi.

We're on our honeymoon.

Oh.
Congratulations.

Thank you.
It's not our honeymoon.

Well... technically.
Not technically.

First time to Jamaica.
Oh, my God.

Sorry for the smell.

Long day slaving
over the old embalming table.

Well, let me just
say that I've been

embalming you with my eyes

since the moment you walked in.

sweet babysitter cash.

Wait, wait.
First, how about a hug?

Hmm?
Aw.

Come here, gene.

Mmm.
(GRUNTS)

You're a good boy.

Uh, weird.

Hmm.

All right, let's wrap this up.

Okay.
I'm ready.

I'll go first.

Like a lamb to the slaughter.

Oh guys! I, uh... I forgot
who sang "funkytown."

I have to go look it up or
it's going to bug me all night.

You're not going anywhere.
Aah!

Keep walking, Tina.

(SIGHS)

Are there bodies
in those coffins?

With all this green mould
around town, better hope not.

What do you mean?
You're joking, right?

Only that green mould turns
bodies into the living dead.

Uh...

Tina, you're a zombiephile.

You should know this!

I'm not a zombiephile.

I have a complicated
relationship with zombies.

They're dangerous,
but I love their swagger.

"Funkytown" is by lips
incorporated. I just remembered.

The morgue.

Well, here goes nothing.

TINA:
Uh...

(LAUGHING)

Every time they say
something horrible,

take a drink.
Bob, stop.

I'm doing it.

So, what's the weirdest
thing you've ever found

in a human body?

Here we go.

You first.

Light bulb.

A football.

A far side calendar.

Really? Huh.

But most of the time,
what I find

is lots and lots of...

BOTH:
Tumours.

Oh, my God, no. Linda.

to open a door?

Okay.

TINA AND GENE:
Aah!

Smells a little mouldy.

And corpse-y.

Bad combo.

I don't think we should be here.

Yeah, let's go back upstairs.

You're totally right, guys.
