### Part1
Welcome back to the office of TTT, where Anna’s interview for a sales job continues.
When we last say goodbye, TTT boss Paul had asked Anna why she wanted the job.
First she said…Since then, she’s added….And as we join her again, Anna is saying…

Come on, Anna! If you can’t think of the word you need, find another way of saying it.
I really really want this job and I am willing to work very hard if I get it.
So you’re very motivated. Mo…I am really…Good why?

### Part2
Now over to you Anna, structure your answer!
Say, ‘firstly’…’secondly’…Then say, ‘above all’…enthusiastic final reason!
Go for it!

Firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and experience, I’ve spent several years working in sales and I get on with people easily. I mean, apart from the ones I don’t like, of course.

Secondly, I know TTT is one of the fastest-growing companies in London, and I want to be part of that.

......plastic fruit sector.

Above all, the reason I want this job is….

### Part3
Is everything alright? 
No, Everything is not OK!
Just as Anna was doing really well, it looks like her interview has come to a sudden end. What’s happened? Join us next time to find out.
But before we go, here’s a reminder of how Anna structured her response:
Anna couldn’t remember the word ‘motivated’, so she just found another way of saying what she meant.
Nice work, Anna! Let’s hope you get the chance to finish your interview next week!
