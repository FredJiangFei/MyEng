The IL. Making a pitch.

### Part1
welcome...CV.
Anna's presentation to ML and his colleagues continues..Her computer has jammed and the prexx, along with her notes, are fronze.
Anna, you're going to have to manage without the slideshow or notes. Just talk!
xx,xx,xxx! What on earth am I going to say? My mind is blank.
Try to remember the key points you wanted to share, and give them one by one. If you can, give some facts that support each point.

### Part2
Sorry about that, I'll just have to continue talking without the slideshow.
Try not to bark out information like a robot. Look people in the eye, slow down and try to be more conversational...and smile!

TTT is growing fast - our number of clients doubled last year.
This is because our company has a strong track record of reliability and because, thanks to new technology, our fruits are more and more convincing.
Our bananas have won awards for being the most authentic-looking fruits in Europe.

We are very happy that CV is alredy among our clients and we hope to build on that by offering you more exciting new fruits.
Let me share with you our latest product: the IL.
The IL's key strengths are its design and flexibility. It is made with revolutionary xxx technology...

### Part3
What an excellent performance from Anna. She focussed on some key points, supported them with facts and structured her answer clearly.
She also managed to relax and sound more natural. She used these phrases:
Let's fast-forward to after meeting to see if she gets an order.

### Part4
...so thank you for your time, I hope you're impressed with our IL.
Fantastic..I'd like to put in an order for three hundred thousand right away.
Good work, I must say, ML seems just as excited about Anna as he is about the lemons. watch out Anna!
