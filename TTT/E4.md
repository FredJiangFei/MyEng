### Part1
Last week, Anna's got the job of sales executive at TTT. thanks to her quick-thinking in an office crsis. 
Today it's her first day in the office. How are you feelling now Anna.
Excited, but a bit worried. I really want to make a good first impression.
you're going to need some phrases to introduce yourself politely, such as:

### Part2
Why don't you start by say hello to Tom, the Senior Account Manager?
Hello, I don't think we've met. 
You must be Tom I'm Anna. I've just joined the team.
Nice to meet you. Have you worked here long?
sorry, I'm quite busy now -- can you do lunch tomorrow? Lunch..at 12:30 then? 

### Part3
Tom asked me to have lunch ready for 12.30.
If I don't start now it won't be ready for you by 12.30.
your misunderstood me, Anna.
When I said "Can you do lunch" I didn't mean "Can you make me lunch" It meant "Are you available to come to lunch with me?" In a cafe or sth.
Just remember- if somebody says "Would you like to do lunch?" they're not usually expecting you to cook for them!
