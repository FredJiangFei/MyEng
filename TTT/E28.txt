MS has announced a new strategy to sell plastic fruit to Europe and hopefully keep the company afloat.

# hospitality / pub
But before the real work begins it's time for him to enjoy some good English hospitality at the pub, courtesy of the team from the London office.

# Let's join them now....

# pint
Can I get you a pint MS?

# You've got to...
One pint won't hurt. You've got to have a pint of beer / when you come to a pub.

# I'm a bit short of cash.
Are you OK to getting your own? I'm a bit short of cash.

# along soon
Anna said she would be along soon.

# smart cookie
She seems like a smart cookie.

# tasty
Not bad, a little warm but tasty.

# I think it's going to his head

# crisps

# no action
What a loser. I can tell he's all talk and no action.

# too personal
I think he's getting a bit too personal.
That beer is making him say things he shouldn't.

###################################################
I don't think it's appropriate to talk like that.

# subject
Could we change the subject please?

Can we keep our conversation professional. There's a lot to discuss about our European market strategy.
###################################################

# keen
You're keen but you've got a lot to learn

# lead
Anyway, you're gonna have to lead this one not that Tom guy.
I'm thinking of firing him, his results ain't that great andâ€¦ 

# nuts

# less strong
how would you like to drink something, less strong?

# do favor
Anna has just done Tom a big favouur - she's stopped him getting fire - for now.
