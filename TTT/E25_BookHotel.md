Hello. Royal Imperial Hotel.
Oh, hello. I'd like to check availability and rates for a room.

When for?
For three nights from tonight. Your best room please!
All our rooms are the best! But… yes, we have one. It's ￡100 a night.

Right. I work with Tom…Tom Darcy… his friend runs the hotel. I wondered if you could offer me a special rate?
Tom Darcy? No I've never heard of him. Sorry, it's still ￡100.

Does the price include breakfast?
Yes. We offer a full continental breakfast of toast, or bread, oh, and tea…or coffee…. and cereal.
Oh. And do you have any business facilities?
Well, we've got paper and pens.
I was thinking, internet, wi fi… shoe shine?
Yes. We've got that.

Good. And most importantly, is this a single room?
We've only got twin rooms.Twins? 
You've only got room for twins?
No. We could take a bed out and leave just one in, if you want?
Oh that would be perfect.

In that case, I'd like to go ahead and make a reservation please.
Good. How would you like to pay?
