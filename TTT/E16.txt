Politely refusing.

### Part1
Hello! You're joining us again / after Anna's call from ML - he asked to lunch, remember. Now A and D are flapping.
...and before you know it, he'll be asking you to marry him. Trust me Anna, this has happened to me dozens of times!
But I thought he was only interested in the lemons! Please promise me you won't mention this to anyone.
Ok, I promise.

### Part2
Good morning ladies. What's going on?
ML has asked Anna to lunch! And it's not to talk business! 
I saw him looking at her with big eyes, from the moment he first saw her!
Don't tell me you said yes!
Well I didn't know what to say. I said I was busy and would call back. 
I wanted to just say no, but with everyone complaining that I'm not polite on the phone...I didn't know how to say it politely.
I'll tell you what to say.
Hang on, let me write it down...why do all the pens keep disappearing?
Here's one. Thanks, Okay, I'm listening Tom.
Go away Slimy Limey. Are you sure?

### Part3
Don't lesten to him A. This is what you should say:
Thank you for your offer. But I'm really sorry, I won't be able to.
Then explain why, say I'm afraid it's against company policy to have non-business lunch with clients.
Meaning?
You're not allowed to if it's not for business.
Then say: It wouldn't be appropriate. So, with regret, I'm going to have to say no.
OK, I think I've got that all down.

### Part4
So, when can I invite you to lunch?
Thank you...
I'm afraid...
It wouldn't be...
Oh dear, he didn't take that too well. But, aprat from a little mistake, Anna did well there.
Here are the phrases she used to politely refuse the offer of lunch:
