# be about to / officially
It's the big day and Mr Socrates is about to arrive at the offices of TTT to talk officially to the team.

# gather
shall we gather round and hear what Mr Socrates has to say?

# big chair
Don't you think I should be sitting in the big chair?

#################################################################### 
I gotta give it to you straight.

# outlook
Things ain’t looking good, in fact the outlook is gloomy.

# recession / meltdown
The global recession has led to a meltdown in the plastic fruits sector.

# profit warning
And I've got to announce a profit warning.
#################################################################### 

# deliver news
He's delivering some bad news without hiding the truth.

# employee / unemployed
 I've been a loyal employee, I couldn't face being unemployed.

# redundancies
I'm not talking about redundancies yet.

# I think he means we're going to sell plastic fruit to the European market.

# once / twice
I had a holiday in Spain once… twice actually.

# bring in
I think you're gonna need some help with this, so I'm bringing in my best marketing executive, Rachel.

# in a few weeks
She'll be here in a few weeks.

# prefer
Do you know if she prefers tea or coffee

# Your necks will be on the line - he means their jobs will be at risk if things don't improve.

# pint / hospitality
 I think we need to take Mr Socrates down to the Rose and Crown / after work / for a pint or two / and show him some true English hospitality.
