Writing an email

### Part1
Hello, Anna's just arrived at her desk to start the day at TTT. 
Paul is walking towards her, eating a biscuit, he looks a bit bothered.
...
You sent him an email yesterday and copied me in.
That's not really the best way of writing an email to a client, is it?
Please could you re-send your message to ML, using actual words that make sense.


### Part2
Let me guess, Paul just spoke to you about your email?
How do you know?
You copied me in remember, I just read it - or tried to.
But what's the problem? Other people write like that!
No, maybe some people write text messages like that in an SMS message on their phones, but that is completely the wrong style for an email to a client.
Okay Anna, let's stop listening to Tom, he's waste of space.
These are the kinds of phrases you need in a business-related email:
Dear Mr Lime..
I hope you are well.
I am writing regarding...
Please could you confirm....
Yours sincerely / Best wishes.

### Part3
Thank you! I'll rewrite my message. I'd better get it checked before I send.
Dxx? On, she's on the phone.
Tom, Could you read this through before I send it?
Hang on, Anna.....

Dear ML. I hope your are well. 
I am writing regarding your request / for luxury boxes for the IL delivery.
We will indeed be able to supply them.
Please could you confirm that you want 300.
Best wishes, Anna.

Hopefully ML will think your last message was just someone sitting on your keyboard by mistake.
Nothing. It's none of my business.
You're not ever going to go to lunch with ML are you? I mean, in a non-business way....
I mean I don't care..It's just..important to...stay professional.

I had a feeling Anna's email was going to cause problems.
But (at least) she won't make a mistake like that again.
Here's a reminder of the phrases she used in her new (improved email):
