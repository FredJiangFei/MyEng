# flustered
Welcome back to TTT where everyone seems a bit flustered.

# in town / just right
You see, the big boss from America, Mr Socrates, is in town and everything must be just right.

# so far
so far he seems OK

# bossy 
A bit bossy, quite short and… a bit smelly!

# hung up
he’s hung up.

# soft / small / single room / twin room
The bed’s too soft, too small and it’s a single room not a twin room.

# insists on
he insists on a twin – something to do with business partners he says. 

# Anything else?

# freshly squeezed orange juice / carton
He says he wanted freshly squeezed orange juice for breakfast, not the stuff out of a carton.

# afford / upset
We can't afford to upset Mr Socrates.

I'm very disappointed with your service. The standard of service is not good enough.
The room I booked did not meet my expectations.

My colleague has made it quite clear that the room did not meet our requirements 
and I would like you to resolve this matter as quickly as possible 
or I will have to cancel our reservation and get a full refund.

Sadly, we have no other twin rooms available and anyway…

He's going to be here any minute and he says he's got some important news for us.
