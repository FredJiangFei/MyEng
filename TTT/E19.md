### left open 
The window was left open overnight.

### blown
My papers have been blown everywhere.

 there's a note from Paul, it must've fallen off my desk

"I would like your ideas on our stock management system for our new fruit range, so we know we can keep up with demand.
Please write me a couple of pages of suggestions and leave it on my desk. I'll be back this afternoon."

I think there's been a misunderstanding.
There's been a bit of a mix up.
Let me explain what happened.

This is an excellent piece of work!

### by far
These are by far the best ideas you've ever had.

### take...from...
Did you take that note from my desk?

### I suppose
I suppose you threw my xxx on the floor at the same time too!

### blown
The wind must have blown the note for Tom under my desk.

### all over the place
Tom left the window open overnight. Our papers were blown all over the place.

### bothered
 I'm not bothered.I've still got some great ideas in my head anyway.

### shine
the mix up gave Anna a chance to shine
