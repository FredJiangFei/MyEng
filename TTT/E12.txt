The big day. Opening presentations

### Part1
It's a big day for Anna. she's about to present TTT's new IL to ML and his colleagues. This must not go wrong.
How are you feeling today Anna?
Scared! I want to do really well. If I mess up and CV doesn't place an order. I'll so upset.
You're well prepared, that's the main thing. Explain clearly how your prexx will be organised.
I didn't think of the very begining. Can you give me examples of what I should say?
After you introduced yourself, you could say:
Everything will be fine. I feel relaxed now.

### Part2
Anna. I've been looking forward to this for days! Everyone is waiting in the meeting room. Come this way...
Everyone in CV is very excited about this new IL, so I allowed a few extras to come and watch, I hope you don't mind.
All your equipment has been set up so you can begin!

### Part3
Anna - focus! breathe deeply, then say:

Today I'm going to present our revolutionary, new IL.
I'll start by telling you a bit about TTT and some of the exciting new developments at our company.
And then I'm going to move on to explain how the IL is designed and what makes it so revolutionary.
And finally, you will all have a chance to see it close up for yourselves and ask questions.
So, let's begin...

### Part4
Well, as usual, Anna seems to be turning a difficult situation into a success.
She used the phrases we discussed, which made her opening clear and well-structured.
But that's just the beginning, now she's got to get through the rest of the pitch - how will that go?
It was all going so well but now Anna's got computer problems. What is she going to do?
We'll find out next time.
