Overtime. Language for working long hours.

### Part1
It's late at the offices of TTT. Anna is alone, working. Again.
She's been doing this all week, she wants her presentation to ML to be perfect / so she's spending hours and hours on it.
Don't interrupt!

Anna, you're really burning the candle at both ends.
xx - it means working very hard - working late and getting up early to work all the time.
I didn't know that expression.
Well here are some more:

You're doing overtime; which means you're working longer than office hours.

You're putting in the hours; which means you are spending all the time needed to achieve sth.
Yes, I'm putting in the hours to make sure my presentation is perferct.

And if you don't mind me saying so, you might burn out; which means you are working so hard you might get very tired and run out of energy.
I'm not burning out. I'm full of energy.

### Part2
My goodness, nothing's locked. Do you think we've been burgled?
Oh no! I left my lap-book and my me-pad on the desk - they're worth thousands! They're all the latest versions!
I left out my elephant mug and my lady-curve nail file. They better not have stolen them!

### Part3
Anna. Have you spent the night asleep at your desk?
Is it morning? Oh dear, yes I think so.
At least we haven't been burgled.

Anna, you're really been burning..ends lately.
Yes, you've been doing hours and hours of overtime. Most people get their work done within office hours and anyway, we don't pay overtime here.
You'll never find me working late!
Yeah, I had noticed that actually Denise.

But this presentation must be perfect. 
If you're not careful, you'll burn out! Then you'll really be of no use to anyone. You'll be as useful as a chocolate teapot.
It's good that you're putting in the hours Anna, but you should calm down. 
Look at me, I do very successful presentations without spending hours preparing.
I bet he actually spent hours preparing he just can't admit it.

Maybe you're right. I can't think clearly anymore. I'm so tired.
I need to sleep properly otherwise I'll end up trying sell bananas instead of lemons.

### Part3
Anna has finally got the message: she's realised she's been working too much. She needs to be realistic.
Here's a reminder of some of the phrases we heard to talk about how much Anna had been working:
Let's hope she's thinking clearly / by the time she has to do her presentation. Join us next time to find out!
