# A lone rider.

# This is what we used to be

# we lived harmoniously alongsideâ€¦ dragons.

# paradise
It was paradise

# mindless / wildfire
Druun, A mindless plague that spread like wildfire, multiplying as they consumed life and turned everyone they touched into stone.

# blasted....away
Sisu, concentrated all her magic into a gem and..blasted the Druun away.

# Except
Everyone that was turned to stone came back. Except the dragons. 

# people being people

# possess
they all fought to possess the last remnant of dragon magic.

# gem

# until 
That didn't truly happen until 500 years later, when I came into the story.

# Not even
I promise you will not set foot on the Dragon Gem's inner circle. Not even a toe.

# blade
You might wanna take out that blade.

# don't beat yourself up too much

# generations / sworn(swear)
For generations, our family has sworn to protect the gem.

# legacy

# The other lands, they're on their way here, as we speak.

# Tail
A sweltering desert with sneaky mercenaries who fight dirty.

# Talon
A floating market famous for fast deals and fighters with even faster hands.

# Spine
A frigid bamboo forest guarded by exceptionally large warriors, and their giant axes.

# Fang
Our fiercest enemy. A nation protected by angry assassins, and their even angrier cats.

# poison
We'll poison them?

# prosperity
They're only our enemies because they think the Dragon Gem magically brings us prosperity.

# ridiculous
That's ridiculous. It doesn't do that.

# assume
They assume it does,

# a matter of time
 if we don't stop and learn to trust one another again, it's only a matter of time / before we tear each other apart.
