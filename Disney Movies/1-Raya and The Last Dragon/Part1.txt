# A lone rider.

# This is what we used to be

# we lived harmoniously alongsideâ€¦ dragons.

# paradise
It was paradise

# mindless / wildfire
Druun, A mindless plague that spread like wildfire, multiplying as they consumed life and turned everyone they touched into stone.

# blasted....away
Sisu, concentrated all her magic into a gem and..blasted the Druun away.

# Except
Everyone that was turned to stone came back. Except the dragons. 

# people being people

# possess
they all fought to possess the last remnant of dragon magic.

# gem

# until 
That didn't truly happen until 500 years later, when I came into the story.
