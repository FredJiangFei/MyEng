SCENE A
### I suffer from short term memory loss
### pretend....
### hide-and-seek
### Now count to ten
### Sand is squishy(things are soft / wet)

SCENE B
Floor it!: telling sb to drive as fast as possible
Now we're talking: agree with a suggestion or like someone's offer
There's no way out: there is no way for us to escape a situation
Get back:
1. telling someone to move away because they are in danger
2. it's late, I need to get back home
3. I forgot my bag on the train and I don't know how to get it back.
