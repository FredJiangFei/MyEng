We are (most definitely keen to proceed with Fred). We are (impressed by) his backend skill and therefore I think he could be (a strong asset) to the team.
Unfortunately, our CTO was (unwell) today so I have a followup call with him tomorrow.
Please give me until midday tomorrow and I can then confirm if we are to proceed with one or both resources.

Unfortunately, we will need to (hold on) to both resources (for the time being).
Our CTO has (enlisted) two other contractors and wants to (assess their performance) and (get them up to speed) before bringing on an additional resource.
I apologise for this (last-minute change). He believes bringing on all resources at once / we will slow progress which we cant afford for immediate projects.

I will (aim to) come back to you in a month's time once team (settles) with current new resources.
