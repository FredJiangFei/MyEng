STAR: situation/task/action/result

(situation) There was one time when a customer's order hadn't arrived, and we didn't know what had happened to it.
(task) The customer was very unhappy, and I had to try to solve the problem for him.
(action) I arranged for a replacement to be sent, thinking we could find out what happened to the previous order later.
(result) In the end, the customer was happy that I could solve his problem quickly and simply.
