### lanuch
The team at TTT are hard at work, making plans for the lanuch and presentation of their latest product: xxxxx.

### brainstorming
They are 'brainstorming', sharing ideas on how to make their lemon a success.

### disagreement 
There is a lot of disagreement going on, which is putting Anna's vocabulary to the test!
Right, I'm taking the final decision: the color shceme will be green and yellow, so that's that.

### a special opening offer
Why don't we offer CV a special opening offer: 20% off IL orders made this month.

### regular clients
We could even do that for all our regular clients.

That would be a big risk.
If we do that once, all our clients will start asking for 20% off everything.

### bankrupt
We'll be bankrupt.

### aggressive
And don't be aggressive Anna - and give your reasons too, or you'll upset Denise again!

###
Well, I'm not so sure about that. I think it will improve our sales of lemons and make our clients happy.
Happy clients will come back to buy more.
Yes, that's a good point Anna.

But 20% is a lot - maybe 5% would be better.
But if we're going to make a special offer, we should make it so good that everyone will say yes!

### get rid of
But people might think there's sth wrong with our lemons and that we're desperate to get rid of them.

### I see your poin
I see your point, but if we explain this is just a special offer for special clients, they'll understand.

I like that idea, Good; 20% off for all regular clients just for this month.
Anna, you'll be making the presentation to CV, so make sure you inculde that offer.
