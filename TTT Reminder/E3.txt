### suddenly interrupted
Anna's interview for a sales has been suddenly interrupted.

### Lost USB stick
You know the PowerPoint presentation? 
The one we've been preparing for the last two months? The one that's very important and that we need this afternoon?
We've lost everything.
I had it on a USB stick to transfer it but the stick has vanished!
But don't you have it saved on your computer? No, it was taking up a lot of space, so I deleted it. So you have lost the only copy we have.

### Solve problem
Can I make a suggestion? 
-- Yes, please do.
Why don't you try looking in your recycle bin? It might still be there. 
-- I did.It isn't.
Have you tried asking your colleagues if they've seen the memory stick? 
-- I did. They haven't. 
How about looking through your rubbish bin to see if you threw it away by mistake? 
-- I don't do silly things like that.
Maybe I could do a big office search for you? I'm good at finding things. 
-- There are confidential documents in this office, non-staff are not allowed to see them.
I have an idea. Did you ever email the presentation to anyone? 
You emailed it to me to proof-read. It'll be in my inbox somewhere. Good thinking Anna. Problem solved.
-- I was just about to make that suggestion myself.

### get job
I suppose you'd like to know if you've got the job?
I would definitely like the job!
