Hello....plastic.

..addiction...concern.., ..doesn’t decay...once use...hangs around...
...’decay’..describes the natural process of sth being destroyed or breaking down into small particles...
We hear...consequences...plastic around...
Indeed. ...mess, wildlife, marine animals...risk...entangled...ingest..
...issue...tackling..., ...discussing..finding out..solve...crisis

# 2 question
...challenge..answer...plastic, Rob. The first synthetic plastic – that’s plastic made entirely from man-made materials - was created over 100 years ago. ..brand nam..? Was it… a) Bakelite, b) Lucite or c) Formica?

I’m no expert...

# 3 question
..reveal...end of... Now...more..plastic. This man-made substance is everywhere - from clothing to crisp packets, and bottles to buckets.

But...biodegradable. That’s a word that describes sth that can decay naturally without harming anything. Each year, 400...produced and 40%...single-use. ..stop..?

# 4 Lucy
..not..easy, Rob, and it’s sth Lucy..has been talking about. She was speaking in a discussion on xx, and explained..quitting plastic but also..attitude..changing…

...weird psychological attachment..., that’s been around and it’s like a push and pull. 
At one time,...horrified by..seeing – ..whales.., the oceans vomiting plastic / beaming in from all over the world. 

..same time..told..live... So that creates a psychological dissonance, ..barrier...change. But..awareness...peaked and...activism.

She mentioned the word ’psychological’, that’s sth that affects or involves our mind. So here, psychological attachment means that in our mind we feel we have to use plastic, we’re addicted.

But we also see the negative impact of plastic, like whales dying. And in our mind we’re also thinking we must stop! This has created what Lucy says is a ’psychological dissonance’.

Dissonance’ means a disagreement between two opposing ideas. So we’re having an argument in our head about the right thing to do. This is the ’push and pull’ of thoughts she referred to.

And this dissonance has been the barrier to us trying to solve the plastic issue. But now we’re starting to do sth about it. We’re taking action to reduce our plastic waste. 

We’re turning to activism. That’s taking action to change sth. It could be social or political change, or a change in our behaviour or attitude.

Of course there has been a big push, that means people have been strongly encouraged to recycle.

Maybe in an ideal world the best thing to do is go plastic-free. But that isn’t easy, is it?

No, it isn’t, and it’s sth Lucy Siegle spoke about. Getting rid of plastic in our lives is a gradual process. But where does she think we can make the biggest difference?

I really think that to concentrate on stopping the flow of plastics into your life is easier and more effective in the long term, than trying to go plastic-free from the outset. We are in the UK, a supermarket culture, so a lot of the tips and tricks to decreasing the flow of plastic are getting round supermarket culture.

She says we have a supermarket culture in the UK. Culture’ here describes a way of life or a way that we generally behave. And in terms of food shopping, we tend to do that in supermarkets.

So, for example, customers can make a big difference by putting pressure on supermarkets to use less plastic packaging. It does seem that the future of plastic is in our hands. We need to be more careful about how and when we use it. And use our collective power to force change if it’s needed.

But there’s no doubt plastic is useful for many things. So it will be a long time before it disappears altogether.

And earlier I asked you what was the name of the first synthetic plastic invented over a 100 years ago. Was it… a) Bakelite,b) Lucite or c) Formica?

And I said c) Formica. Was I right?

Formica is a type of hard plastic used for covering tables and working areas in kitchens. But it’s not the oldest type. That was Bakelite.

I may have got that wrong, but hopefully I’ll have more success recapping some of today’s vocabulary. Starting with ’decay’, which describes the natural process of sth being destroyed or breaking down into small particles, which plastic takes a long time to do.

Next we had ’biodegradable’. That’s a word to describe sth that can decay naturally without harming anything.

Then we had ’psychological’, that’s sth that affects or involves your mind.

Next up, we had ’dissonance’, which describes a disagreement between two opposing ideas.

And then we mentioned ’activism’, that’s taking action to change sth. 

We also mentioned the phrase ’a big push’ which means people are strongly encouraged or persuaded to do sth, usually by force.

And finally we had culture. In our context of supermarket culture, it describes a way of life or a way that we generally behave.
