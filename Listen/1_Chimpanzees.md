Hello. This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Rob

And I’m Sam
# cover of a magazine
Having your photograph appear on the cover of a magazine makes you famous around the world. 

# chimpanzees
But imagine if that photo showed you hugging and playing with wild chimpanzees

# shot to fame / National Geographic magazine(photographs)
That’s exactly what happened to Jane Goodall who shot to fame in 1965 / when she appeared on the cover of National Geographic magazine. 
Jane introduced the world / to the social and emotional lives / of the wild chimpanzees of Gombe, in eastern Tanzania

Jane spent years living among families of wild chimpanzees. 

# observations / view
Her observations changed the way we view our closest animal relatives – and made us think about what it means to be human

# environmentalist
In this programme, we’ll be hearing from the iconic environmentalist Jane Goodall. 

# uncovered / apes / primates / gorillas / orang-utans
She reflects on how attitudes have changed / as science has uncovered the deep connections / between humans and the great apes – large primates including chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans, who are closely related to humans

# along the way
And of course we’ll be learning some related vocabulary along the way

# chimps
As well as Dr Goodall, the National Geographic photographs also made the chimpanzees of Gombe famous. 
People around the world became interested in the lives of a family of chimps living in a remote corner of Africa

# obituary
When Gombe’s alpha female died in 1972, she was so well-loved / that she had an obituary in The Times newspaper. 
But what was her name? That’s our quiz question: which chimpanzee’s obituary / appeared in The Times? Was it

?,a) Frodo
b Flo?, or
?c) Freud

# a bit before my time
Well, 1972 is a bit before my time, Rob – I wasn’t even born then, but I think it’s b) Flo

OK, Sam, we’ll find out later if you were right. 

# capable of
Now, when Jane first visited Tanzania in the 1960s / most scientists believed / the only animals capable of making and using tools were humans. 

# witnessed / turned this idea
But what Jane witnessed about the behaviour of one chimpanzee, who she named Greybeard, turned this idea on its head. 

# recalls / podcast
Here she recalls that famous day to Jim, for the podcast of BBC

# stems / termite mound
I could see this black hand / picking grass stems and pushing them down into the termite mound and pulling them out with termites clinging on with their jaws. 

# leafy twig / strip / not only....but....
And the following day, I saw him pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves, so not only was he using objects as tools but modifying those objects to make tools

# observed
Jane observed the chimpanzee, Greybeard, finding small wooden branches called twigs and modifying them – changing them slightly in order to improve them

# instruments
By stripping away the leaves from twigs and using them to collect ants and termites to eat, Greybeard had made a tool – an instruments or simple piece of equipment, for example a knife or hammer, that you hold in your hands and use for a particular job

# incapable
Previously, it was believed that animals were incapable of making tools on their own. 

# intelligence
What Jane saw was proof of the intelligence of wild animals. 

# convinced
Jane Goodall’s studies convinced her that chimps experience the same range of emotions as humans, as she explains here to BBC

# pat / reassurance / alleviate
I wasn’t surprised that chimps had these emotions. It was fascinating to realise how many of their gestures are like ours… so you can watch them without knowing anything about them and when they greet with a kiss and embrace, they pat one another in reassurance, they hold hands, they seek physical contact to alleviate nervousness or stress – you know, it’s so like us

Holding hands, embracing and kissing were some of the chimpanzee’s gestures – movements made with hands, arms or head, to express ideas and feelings
In the same way as humans, the chimpanzees would pat each other – touch someone gently and repeatedly with their hand held flat

Much of their behaviour was human-like. Just as I would hug a friend to reassure them, the chimps used physical contact to alleviate stress – make pain or problems less intense or severe. 
In fact, chimps are so alike us that sometimes they even get their name in the newspaper
Ah yes, Sam, you mean the quiz question I asked you earlier: which chimpanzee had their obituary published in The Times

And I guessed it was b) Flo

And that’s absolutely right. Well done, Sam! Give yourself a pat on the back

OK. In this programme, we’ve been hearing about legendary zoologist and activist, Jane Goodall, and her experiences living among great apes – primates like chimpanzees who are humans’ closest animal relatives

# alter
Jane witnessed the chimpanzees of Gombe modify – or slightly alter, objects like leaves and twigs to make tools – hand-held instruments used for a particular job

Many of the chimpanzees’ gestures – body movements made to communicate and express emotions – like kissing and patting – touching someone gently and repeatedly with a flat hand – were almost human
And just like us, the chimps sought physical contact to alleviate – or reduce the severity of, nervousness and stress

That’s all for this programme

Bye for now
